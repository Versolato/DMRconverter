##PROJECT: DMRconverter

This is a very simple script to convert DMR Radio IDs to IP addresses and IP addresses to DMR Radio IDs. It is useful when you are using the DMR radio network as a data network to connect PCs, using DMR radios as network interfaces.

It has a fair amount of error checking, and you may supply multiple IPs and/or Radio IDs on the command line, or at each interactive prompt.
