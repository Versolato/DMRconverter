##PROJECT: DMRconverter

This is a very simple script to convert DMR Radio IDs to IP addresses and IP addresses to DMR Radio IDs. It is useful when you are using the DMR radio network as a data network to connect PCs, using DMR radios as network interfaces.

It has VERY little error checking. It's just a quick, dirty little program to get the job done.
